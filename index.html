		<h1> OVERVIEW </h1>
		<h3> VIDHI BAGADIA </h3>
		<hr>
		<br /><br />
            <p>I am a <b>Computer Science and Engineering Graduate</b>, who likes to challenge herself on domains of programming and literature. </p>
            <p>Coding is one of the major sources of powering me up as it makes my brain cells go for a run every time I try and solve a problem. Technology advancements, inspite of my tech background, always keeps me amused, surprised, and on the edge of my seat.</p>
            <p>Apart from coding, I sometimes write in an attempt to shoot out my thoughts to the universe. This is something I've been doing since before I was a teenager.</p>
            <p>Creativity, in both aspects, technology and literature, has always been unstoppable and inevitable, more so when it comes to technology. It never stops. From the first computer and patch cords to Personal Computers to Touch Screens to Voice Controlled Assistants â€“ we have never stopped to expand our reach.</p>
            <p>And me implementing what I've learnt is my attempt at contributing to this ever-expanding community.</p>
