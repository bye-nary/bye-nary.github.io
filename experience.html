            <li> <h4>SMART INDIA HACKATHON, 2017</h4><br />
                <p><b>SMART INDIA HACKATHON 2017</b> was the first ever debut hackathon organised by the <b>Government of India</b> to spread and receive ideas on various issues concerning the different departments of ministries.</p><p>
			Out of thousands of teams, my team, DIGI8, grabbed the chance to enter into the finale for one of the Ministries.</p><p>
                The Project was based on making a centralised portal for NE tourism. The team was one of the <b>top eight</b> teams that received the chance to formally present their idea to a group of experienced jury.</p>
                <p><i>Project Name: SCENES</i></p><br />

            <li><h4>IDEATHON 2017: YOUTH INNOVATIONS FOR A BRIGHTER ASSAM</h4><br />
                <p><b>IDEATHON 2017</b> was an Idea + Implementation Hackathon organised by a module of <b>Goverment of Assam</b>, viz., The Centre for Sustainable Development Goals and UNDP.</p><p>
                The teams had to present either a social or technical solution to the problem statements. We had opted for a mixture of both. Among teams from all over Assam, our team had secured one of the two <b> winning spots</b> whose ideas are to be implemented in a small village.</p>
